# IBM Containers Developer Summit Quick Lab -  build and deploy ai services in containers

The Container Developer Summit is a full day of talks and networking with speakers from Alibaba, Kong, NeuVector, IBM and others.

Free and open to all - come and learn about Containers, its ecosystem and how to leverage Containers in the enterprise. Bring your questions and appetite for learning.

Learn about event speakers and talks: http://containersdevelopersummit.splashthat.com

- onion container:
based on app running

# Speakers

Michael Ka (NeuVector)
- How to Detect and Prevent Containers and Kubernetes Attacks

### Kubernetes vs OpenStack
- Kubernetes had an incredible adaption rate
- OpenStack is very problematic
- Q-con in Seattle: December

Container Environment Problems:
- sharing information in kernel
- ddos vulnerability
- monitor and find running containers inside systems
- who would want to build a product inside your container image

cant deal with using static technology policy: 
did you check the windows and lock doors

- using only ip tables and port number
- clever layer 7 routing to: ab testing, service brakers, 

inspect a network trafic and inspect what it is:
- talking over host bridge
deamon performing depacking
using information of requests
create rolls of says its ok but still look at package after encrytion
most attacks use valid credentials

- control runtime secury at: endpoint and network
- dns request on port 53 being known as trafic

Security Tools:
- rback, secure docker daemon, auditing w/ K8 CIS Benchmark
- quarantine a container, Service Mesh, DLP Dervice
- scan containers, and 

- jfrog: xray - operates in the pipeline

### Andy Shi (Alibaba)
How to secure containers

Securing today with: Cgroup and NameSpace
- Hypervisor
- gVisor: Googles secure
Sandbox protection approach

### Kevin Chen (Kong)
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this container!

Konghq.com
sto: complex service mesh 
Kuma: service mesh

### Anthony Amanse (IBM)
Building applications on the cloud with OpenShift


### Marek Sadowski and Dave Nugent (IBM)
Kubernetes vs. OpenShift
- OpenShift runs DevOps and most services for you
- updating YAM files to spin more clusters
- Integrated Authorisation Services
- RedHat uses stable versions but doesn't update quickly

Contribute to: 
- Origin Community 
- Upstream Distribution

### Ravikumar Alluboyina (Robin.io)
1-Click deployment of Hadoop cluster on IBM IKS Platform with https://get.robin.io

- Why modernize: It takes time and must alwaus u
The Process philosophy:
- Docker process is not enough
- corupts virtualization creates problems in: cpu, memory & storage
- datanodes are related and need to understand content to store properly
Datanodes, problem of replication:
- virtual stack can end up on same spindle
- have to seperate different volume
- data can't go to the same drive
Active active system:
- Oracle RAC is a beast: multiple ip...
- eastwest direction
